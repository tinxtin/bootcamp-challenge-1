# edx-bootcamp-challenge-1

## Description
This a on-the-job ticket challenge as part of the edx front end bootcamp. This is part 1 of 2 challenges on week 1 module. The files contains html, css and README for a web page for a client. As a developer I was assign to make the client application more accessible for search engines like Google and users with disabilities that find it difficult to access their website.

In order to achieve this goal, more semantic html tags are used throughout the code. Aswell as adding more classes with naming convention in mind. The css files has commented to ensure that its tells the client exactly the purpose of each css selector and the layout css has been organized to follow the html structure for more convenience coding experience.
